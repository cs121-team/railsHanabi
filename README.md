## Overview

The final version of this app can be found at [http://hanabi.yancey.io:3000/](http://hanabi.yancey.io:3000/).

This app implements the card game Hanabi. Hanabi, which is typically played in-person, is a cooperative game in which players hold their cards outwards so that they can see other players' cards but not their own. Other players are allowed to give each other limited numbers of hints to help each player play correctly. Full rules for Hanabi can be found [here.](http://www.spillehulen.dk/resources/product/EDR/RG8/69/Hanabi%20Card%20Game%20Rules.pdf)

The app was initially created for an assignment in Harvey Mudd's CS 121 class.

## Platform

The app was built using Ruby on Rails. Specifically, the project uses Ruby version XXX and Rails XXX. We also used Redis with ActionCable to allow for real-time updates from the server.

## Architecture


## How to Run It
0. Install Ruby and Rails
1. Install redis. (INSERT LINK)
2. Clone this repository.

3. Open a terminal window. Cd into the project directory, and run "redis-server".
4. Open another terminal window. Cd into the project directory, and run "rails s".
5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/. The app should be working!
6. To simulate multiple users, open multiple browser windows.
